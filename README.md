# FTB Materials

FTB Materials is our home grown resources mod that attempts to provide a wide range of resources from a wide range of mods. It's designed to provide a unified set of resources and recipes to simplify resource unification in Modpack. 

Our mod is likened to mods like [`Emendatus Enigmatica`](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/emendatus-enigmatica), [`All the Ores`](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ato), etc but differs in a few ways. Primarily, it's designed to hold all resources, not just the ones we need, this is intended for mods like KubeJS to remove anything that is not needed. We do not require addons to provide additional resources, and we're un-opinionated on world gen allowing modpacks to unify mods ore gen to our resources.

## Modpack Notes

Our mod is designed to work with mods like [Almost Unified](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/almost-unified) to provide the unification systems as we acknowledge that attempting to home-bake, first-class mod support, unification is a large undertaking and others have already done it very well. We also recommend using mods like [KubeJS](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/kubejs) to remove any resources that are not needed in your modpack.

We aim to avoid changing resource Id's as much as possible to avoid breaking modpacks / mods over time.
